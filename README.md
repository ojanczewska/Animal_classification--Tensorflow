# Animal_classification--Tensorflow
Based on the tutorial on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a model was made to recognize certain breeds of cats / dogs from the attached dataset ('animals_resized' folder).
Additionally, the visualization of the learning process using a tensorbord was implemented, as well as the export of training data to tfrecord files and the export of the network model to h5 and json.
